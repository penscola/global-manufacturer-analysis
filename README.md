5. Task Details
This Notebook has been written with an interest in the task "Make a tool to predict car value" from the task "Car Price Regression Model" from the "100,000 UK Used Car Dataset" Dataset.

More specifically, the purpose of this notebook is to have some insights and visualisations of the dataset as a whole and create a generalized used car price prediction model.

Context of the Dataset
"Scraped data of used cars listings. 100,000 listings, which have been separated into files corresponding to each car manufacturer. I collected the data to make a tool to predict how much my friend should sell his old car for compared to other stuff on the market, and then just extended the data set. Then made a more general car value regression model."
